### Environment Setup
In order to run the code samples we will need a Kafka and Flink cluster up and running.
You can also run the Flink examples from within your favorite IDE in which case you don't need a Flink Cluster.

If you want to run the examples inside a Flink Cluster run the following command to start the services.
```shell
docker-compose up
```

When the cluster is up and running successfully run the following command for redpanda:
```shell
./redpanda-setup.sh

```

or this command for kafka setup
```shell
./kafka-setup.sh
```

To populate the topics, run 
- ```src/main/java/io/streamingledger/producers/TransactionsProducer.java```
- ```src/main/java/io/streamingledger/producers/StateProducer.java```


# Flink SQL
```shell
docker exec -it jobmanager ./bin/sql-client.sh
```

### Register UDF
```shell
CREATE FUNCTION maskfn  AS 'io.streamingledger.udfs.MaskingFn'      LANGUAGE JAVA USING JAR '/opt/flink/jars/spf-0.1.0.jar';
CREATE FUNCTION splitfn AS 'io.streamingledger.udfs.SplitFn'        LANGUAGE JAVA USING JAR '/opt/flink/jars/spf-0.1.0.jar';
CREATE FUNCTION lookup  AS 'io.streamingledger.udfs.AsyncLookupFn'  LANGUAGE JAVA USING JAR '/opt/flink/jars/spf-0.1.0.jar';

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW sample AS
SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
LIMIT 10;

SELECT transactionId, maskfn(UUID()) AS maskedCN FROM sample;
SELECT * FROM transactions, LATERAL TABLE(splitfn(operation));

SELECT 
  transactionId,
  serviceResponse, 
  responseTime 
FROM sample, LATERAL TABLE(lookup(transactionId));
```

### Deploy a JAR file
1. Package the application and create an executable jar file
```shell
mvn clan package
```
2. Copy it under the jar files to be included in the custom Flink images

3. Start the cluster to build the new images by running
```shell
docker-compose up
```

4. Deploy the flink job
```shell
docker exec -it jobmanager ./bin/flink run \
  --class io.streamingledger.datastream.BufferingStream \
  jars/spf-0.1.0.jar
```
